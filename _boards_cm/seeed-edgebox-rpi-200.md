This DIN rail mount inudstrial computer has built-in expansion, a Phoenix connector with multiple isolated inputs and outputs, and all the typical industrial interfaces (CANBUS, RS485, and more), and is easy to take apart and rebuild for any purpose, from remote sensing to industrial controls.

There's even a version with a small built-in UPS!
