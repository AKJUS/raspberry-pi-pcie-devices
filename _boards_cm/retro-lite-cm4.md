The Retro Lite CM4 is a sleek, handheld gaming console to be completed early 2021. It is a collaboration project between StonedEdge and Dmcke5 on the BitBuilt forums. It is modelled in SolidWorks and the PCBs were designed in EAGLE. The project is a work in progress, but we hope to have it all done very soon! Final shell will be done in 6061 aluminum.
