Pierluigi Colangeli designed a variety of 'MINIMA' CM5 carrier boards, suitable for different purposes. All are open source hardware, and can be tweaked for your own needs (indeed, someone's already [morphed one into a Cubesat build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpIjtnP0WAk)).

The three options currently available include:

  - [REV1](https://github.com/piecol/CM5_MINIMA_REV1) - includes a RAK wireless LoRa module
  - [REV2](https://github.com/piecol/CM5_MINIMA_REV2) - includes a 2230 M.2 NVMe slot
  - [AI Edition](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pierluigi-colangeli_minima-cm5-oshw-activity-7327603359085940736-F8av) - along with some other versions for other purposes!

You can find the [REV2 on Elecrow](https://www.elecrow.com/cm5-minima-r-2.html), and the AI Edition may appear on Seeed Studios store soon.
