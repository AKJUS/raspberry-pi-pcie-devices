The TOFU board is a carrier board for use with Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4). Inspired by the official CM4IO board, it is intended for industrial applications. With user friendly additions, it may also be used by enthusiasts looking for a compact yet complete solution to interface the many inputs and outputs of the single board computer.
