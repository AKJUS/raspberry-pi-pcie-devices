This 4x SATA NAS board by [Wiretrustee](https://wiretrustee.com) operates over the PCIe bus on the Compute Module 4 to deliver at least 220 MB/sec RAID performance. The integrated Marvell 88SE9215 controller does the PCIe <-> SATA signal conversion.

The board will be made available [through Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/wiretrustee/wiretrustee-sata), and there will be 2.5" and 3.5" hard drive enclosures for it.

You can also visit [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/wiretrustee/cm4-sata-board) for open source files for the SATA board and enclosure.
