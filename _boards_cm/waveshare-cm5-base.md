The CM5 Base A and B are CM5 carrier boards in the same footprint as a Raspberry Pi model B, but with some welcome improvements, like an M.2 NVMe slot (2230/2242 size) on the bottom, a CR1220 battery holder for RTC, a rear-facing USB-C power input for easier rack-mounting, and a full-size HDMI port on the port side, so all ports are on opposite sides. It still breaks out CSI/DSI connections, all USB ports (half through a small FPC header), the other HDMI port (also through a header), and GPIO.
