Pi-Cast makes a variety of small PiKVM boxes with various features, from extra USB ports to a built-in KVM switcher for multiple inputs. Their basic model offers Ethernet over the USB 3.0 USB-C connection that also powers the device, so you can manage a device using only a tablet (like an iPad) or direct wire it to your computer.
