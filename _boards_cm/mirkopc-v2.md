A 2nd version of the MirkoPC, a 9cm x 9cm mini PC powered by a Compute Module 5.

Some of the improvements / features over the original MirkoPC:

  - All ports are on one side now (so there's a true 'front' with power, IR, buzzer, and a 'back' with IO)
  - Two full-size HDMI ports
  - PoE+ support built-in (with a socket that accepts a plug-in PoE+ module
  - PCIe splitter (not a switch in this version, so it's either/or, with preference for the M.2 M-key slot)
  - USB 3.0 x2 and USB 2.0 x2 through the CM5 RP1 chip
  - Support for the official Pi 5 Active Cooler (and compatible coolers), using included longer mounting spring legs
  - (eventually) full metal enclosure
  - (right now) 3D printable enclosure
