The [Hailo-8L](https://hailo.ai/products/ai-accelerators/hailo-8l-ai-accelerator-for-ai-light-applications/) is Hailo's 'Entry Level' AI accelerator, meant for edge and lighter use cases.

It runs at 13 TOPS, and 8 TOPS/W, and was announced late last year. It [comes in two M.2 form factors](https://hailo.ai/files/hailo-8l-product-brief-en/), a 2242-size B+M-key version, and a 2230-size A+E-key version.

The Hailo-8L is included in Raspberry Pi's [AI Kit](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/ai-kit/), and use with the Raspberry Pi is documented here: [AI Kit Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/ai-kit.html). Hailo maintains example code and more documentation on their GitHub: [hailo-rpi5-examples](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-rpi5-examples).
