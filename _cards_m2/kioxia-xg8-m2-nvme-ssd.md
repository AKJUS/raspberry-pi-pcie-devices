I received five [KIOXIA XG8 M.2 NVMe SSD](https://americas.kioxia.com/en-us/business/ssd/client-ssd/xg8.html) drives for testing in a clustered storage scenario. In individual testing, the XG8 had no problem working with the Pi 5.

I was able to get around 450 MB/sec in sequential reads under PCIe Gen 2.0 speeds, and 900 MB/sec under PCIe Gen 3.0.
