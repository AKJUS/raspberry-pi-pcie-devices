The [Pinedrive NVMe SSD 256GB (2242)](https://pineboards.io/products/pinedrive-nvme-ssd-256gb-2242) costs â‚¬45,99 EUR (about $50 USD as of this writing), and is verified to work with the Raspberry Pi 5 (and earlier generations).

It's a white-labeled 3D TLC NAND SSD running at PCIe Gen 3 x4, and on a faster computer, should get up to 2.2 GB/sec reads and 1.3 GB/sec writes. On the Pi 5's single PCIe Gen 3 lane, it should get around 850 MB/sec.

The drive has a 3 year warranty with a 1.5m hour MTBF and 200 TBW.
