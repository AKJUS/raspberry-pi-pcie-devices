Pineboards offers a [Hat AI! Dual Edge Coral TPU Bundle for Raspberry Pi 5](https://pineboards.io/products/hat-ai-dual-edge-coral-tpu-bundle-for-raspberry-pi-5), which unites a Dual Edge Coral TPU for AI/ML/inference to the Raspberry Pi 5, through a PCIe Switch to support both PCIe lanes for both TPUs.

Most other E-key PCIe HATs only support one PCIe lane, so if you installed a Dual Edge TPU, you would only have access to one of the two TPUs.

Pineboards also includes a Dual Edge TPU with this bundle, so you don't need to source your own from another vendor.
