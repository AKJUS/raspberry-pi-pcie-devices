Pineboards uPCIty Lite adds an open-ended PCIe x4 slot on top of the Pi 5.

To supply power to cards under test, it provides a 12V barrel plug power input, or a 4-pin ATX CPU power input, allowing up to 12v at 8A. The power supply is completely isolated from the Pi's own FFC (so you must use an external power supply with this HAT, it will not power anything through the Pi 5 directly).
