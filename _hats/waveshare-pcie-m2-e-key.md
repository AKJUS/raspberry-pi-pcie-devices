The PCIe to M.2 E-Key HAT+ HAT is intended for WiFi and Bluetooth cards, like the Intel AX210, or the BE200.

The HAT comes with antenna cables, two external SMA antenna jacks, mounting hardware, and a USB A to JST adapter cable so Bluetooth functionality can be used through the E-key slot for E and A+E key cards.

More info and Driver setup instructions for popular WiFi cards is located [on Waveshare's Wiki](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/PCIE_TO_M.2_E_KEY_HAT+).
