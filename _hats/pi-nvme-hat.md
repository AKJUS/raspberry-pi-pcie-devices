The Raspberry Pi M.2 NVMe HAT allows you to add on 2230 and 2242-size NVMe SSDs, and fits inside the official Pi 5 case, though with little room for airflow.

There is enough room underneath to fit an Active Cooler.

The M.2 HAT is also used as the base for the AI Kit, which attaches a Hailo-8L AI Accelerator to the Raspberry Pi 5.
