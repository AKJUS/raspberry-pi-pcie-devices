This HAT includes two 2.5 Gbps Ethernet ports (Realtek 8125BG), an M.2 M-key NVMe slot (2230, 2242, 2260, 2280), and a 12V power input.

The interfaces are adapted through an ASM2806 PCIe Gen 3 switch, with 2 uplinks (the Pi 5 can only use 1), and 4 downlinksâ€”the 4th is exposed as a Pi 5 style PCIe FPC header, so you can daisy-chain other PCIe boards on top of this one!

It has a 40 pin GPIO plug, which supplies power to the Pi, and it is not pass-through type, so you would not be able to mount another HAT on top of this board.

**You must manually enable the external PCIe connector** to get this HAT to work on the Pi 5. Also, if you want Gen 3.0 speeds, also add that setting in `/boot/firmware/config.txt` and reboot:

```
dtparam=pciex1
dtparam=pciex1_gen=3
```

I am currently testing the board and will update this page with more information later.
