[HackerGadgets](https://hackergadgets.com) / Vileer described an [NVME Hat for Raspberry Pi 5](https://twitter.com/vileer_com/status/1746743319307407861) on Twitter, which would be the first such card with a cutout specifically for the fan position in the Pi case (many people have asked 'what about ventilation so you don't block the fan from hitting the SoC below!).

There was also an [earlier prototype](https://twitter.com/vileer_com/status/1746743319307407861) which included PoE power supplyâ€”but it was showing low voltage warnings due to using PoE instead of PoE+ power.
