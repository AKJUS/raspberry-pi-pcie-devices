Waveshare's PCIe to M.2 + PoE HAT outputs 5V at 4.5A to the Pi, and includes a 12V 2A header as well. There is a small fan included, which blows air in through the top down towards the Pi, just over the SoC/RAM, so it should be able to keep the Pi cool in most environments, probably even without a heatsink.

It has cutouts for display/camera cables, but doesn't look like it'll fit inside the official Pi 5 case.
