Pimoroni's NVMe Base adds a twist to the concept of an NVMe mounted underneath the Pi 5—or rather, a 'bend'.

The included PCIe adapter cable has two 90° bends in it so it can be connected under the Pi while maintaining easy access to the microSD card slot (this is very hard to do on other under-mount designs, since the PCIe cable gets in the way).
