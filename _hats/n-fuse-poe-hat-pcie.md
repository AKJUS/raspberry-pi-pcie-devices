n\|fuse has a set of PCIe HATs including PoE+ support, for:

  - mini PCIe
  - M.2 M-key
  - M.2 B-key
  - M.2 E-key

The HATs support 25W power delivery with active cooling, or 15W without. It also has a 5V output on an optional pin header, and includes a Nano-SIM slot for the B-key variant.

It supplies 5A of power to the Pi, so it should be capable of powering USB devices without current limiting too.
