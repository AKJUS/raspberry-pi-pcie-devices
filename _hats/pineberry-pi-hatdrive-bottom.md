The Pineberry Pi HatDrive! Top is an M.2 HAT for the Raspberry Pi 5. It accepts 2242 or 2280-sized NVMe SSDs (or any other PCIe device with M.2 M-key), and includes a 40mm FPC cable to connect the HAT to the Pi's PCIe external connector.

I am currently testing this board and will add more information here in the future, like how to enable the Pi's PCIe bus, how to mount the board, and any other interesting features like interfaces for power monitoring or status display.
