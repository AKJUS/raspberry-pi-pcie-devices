The TimeHAT V2 places a PTP-capable Intel i226 2.5 Gbps Ethernet NIC on a Pi HAT with PPS in/out.

The HAT also includes a B-key M.2 slot capable of holding a GPS module; the one I am testing includes a u-blox ZED-F9T-00B-01.

The [TimeHAT hardware was incubated](https://github.com/ahmadexp/Time-Appliance-Project/tree/036bb8fea75baecc263980340a2ceb897a4d9f9c/Incubation/Hardware/TimeHAT) in the OCP Time Appliances Project repository.
