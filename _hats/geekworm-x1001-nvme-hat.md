Geekworm's [X1001](https://wiki.geekworm.com/X1001) is an NVMe SSD HAT for the Pi 5, supporting 2230/2242/2260/2280 NVMe M.2 SSDs.

It is extremely thin, just using three mounting screws to hold the SSD in place over the Pi, so it gives ample room for cooling the Pi underneath, and access to the GPIO pins.

Geekworm also sells the [X1000](https://amzn.to/421y03S) supporting 2230 and 2242 SSDs, and the [X1002](https://amzn.to/48vAqdl) supporting 2230/2242/2260/2280 SSDs.
